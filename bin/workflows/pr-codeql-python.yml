    #   # Using the default codeql suite since it will take less time and only use high precision queries.
    #   # If you want to use a different query suite, you can specify it here.
    #   # The GHAS out-of-the-box query suites are:
    #   #   `null` - The default suite of queries. Only high precision queries.
    #   #            Recommended for pull request workflows.
    #   #   `security-extended` - Queries from the default suite, plus lower severity and lower precision queries.
    #   #   `security-and-quality` - Queries from security-extended suite, plus maintainability and reliability queries.
    #   #                            Recommended for use in main branch workflows.

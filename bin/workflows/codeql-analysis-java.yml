        #   The GHAS out-of-the-box query suites are:
        #     `null` - The default suite of queries. Only high precision queries.
        #              Recommended for pull request workflows.
        #     `security-extended` - Queries from the default suite, plus lower severity and lower precision queries.
        #     `security-and-quality` - Queries from security-extended suite, plus maintainability and reliability queries.
        #                              Recommended for use in main branch workflows.

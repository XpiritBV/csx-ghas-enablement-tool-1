      # Using the larger CodeQL suite here for more comprehensive scanning.
      # If you want to use a different query suite, you can specify it here.
      # The GHAS out-of-the-box query suites are:
      #   `null` - The default suite of queries. Only high precision queries.
      #            Recommended for pull request workflows.
      #   `security-extended` - Queries from the default suite, plus lower severity and lower precision queries.
      #   `security-and-quality` - Queries from security-extended suite, plus maintainability and reliability queries.
      #                            Recommended for use in main branch workflows.
      # For info about CodeQL query suites see: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/codeql-query-suites
